Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects an estimated 8–13% of reproductive-aged women.
Up to 70% of affected women remain undiagnosed worldwide.
PCOS is the commonest cause of anovulation and a leading cause of infertility.
PCOS is associated with a variety of long-term health problems that affect physical and emotional wellbeing.
PCOS runs in families, but there are ethnic variations in how PCOS manifests itself and how it affects people.
Overview
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition that affects women of reproductive age. It usually starts during adolescence, but symptoms may fluctuate over time.

PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, excess androgen levels and cysts in the ovaries. Irregular periods, usually with a lack of ovulation, can make it difficult to become pregnant. PCOS is a leading cause of infertility.

PCOS is a chronic condition and cannot be cured. However, some symptoms can be improved through lifestyle changes, medications and fertility treatments. 

The cause of PCOS is unknown but women with a family history or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk.""")

st.write("""**Scope of the problem:**
Symptoms of PCOS often start around the time of the first menstrual period. Sometimes symptoms develop later after you have had periods for a while.

The symptoms of PCOS vary. A diagnosis of PCOS is made when you have at least two of these:

Irregular periods. Having few menstrual periods or having periods that aren't regular are common signs of PCOS. So is having periods that last for many days or longer than is typical for a period. For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year. And those periods may occur more than 35 days apart. You may have trouble getting pregnant.
Too much androgen. High levels of the hormone androgen may result in excess facial and body hair. This is called hirsutism. Sometimes, severe acne and male-pattern baldness can happen, too.
Polycystic ovaries. Your ovaries might be bigger. Many follicles containing immature eggs may develop around the edge of the ovary. The ovaries might not work the way they should.
PCOS signs and symptoms are typically more severe in people with obesity.""")
st.write("""**Symptoms:**
Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome can differ from person to person. Symptoms may change over time and often occur without a clear trigger.

Possible symptoms include:

1. Heavy, long, intermittent, unpredictable or absent periods
2. Infertility
3. Acne or oily skin
4. Excessive hair on the face or body
5. Male-pattern baldness or hair thinning
6. weight gain, especially around the belly.

People with PCOS are more likely to have other health conditions including:

1. Type 2 diabetes
2. Hypertension (high blood pressure)
3. High cholesterol
4. Heart disease
5. Endometrial cancer (cancer of the inner lining of the uterus). 
6. PCOS can also cause anxiety, depression and a negative body image. Some symptoms such as infertility, obesity and unwanted hair growth can lead to social stigma. This can affect other life areas such as family, relationships, work and involvement in the community.

st.write("""**Diagnosis:**
Polycystic ovary syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of at least two out of the following:

signs or symptoms of high androgens (unwanted facial or bodily hair, loss of hair from the head, acne or an elevated blood level of testosterone) – after other causes for this have been excluded;
irregular or absent menstrual periods – after other causes for this have been excluded; and
polycystic ovaries on an ultrasound scan.
Blood tests can be used to identify characteristic changes in hormone levels, although these changes are not universal. Women with polycystic ovary syndromemay have elevated levels of:

testosterone (an ovarian androgen hormone that influences hair growth);
oestrogen (an ovarian hormone that stimulates growth of the womb lining (endometrium);
luteinising hormone (LH, a pituitary hormone which influences hormone production by the ovaries and is important for normal ovulation);
insulin (a hormone that is principally involved in utilization of energy from food); and
anti-müllerian hormone (which is measures the fertility level of the ovaries).
When making a diagnosis, doctors also take into account that irregular periods and ovulation can be a normal part of puberty or menopause, having polycystic ovaries may run in families, and women with a family history of PCOS or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk of PCOS. In addition, the ultrasound picture is not always clear and some women with PCOS may have an ultrasound scan that does not demonstrate polycystic ovaries.

**Treatment:**
There is no cure for PCOS, but treatments can improve symptoms.

People who have irregular periods, trouble getting pregnant or excessive acne and hair growth should speak to a healthcare professional.

Some symptoms of PCOS can be reduced through lifestyle changes. Eating a healthy diet and getting enough exercise can help reduce weight and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. 

Birth control medicines (contraceptive pill) can help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce symptoms. Other medicines can reduce acne or unwanted hair growth caused by PCOS. 

Treatments for infertility due to PCOS include lifestyle changes, medicines or surgery to stimulate regular ovulation. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) may be used but it has some risks.
